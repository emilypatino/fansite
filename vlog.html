            <li><spam>Matt King</spam>, Top left. (Check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxSz6JVYmzVhtkraHWZC7HQ">Youtube Channel</a>) Love his reactions when David pranks him or love it when in general, he is just being himself. :} </li>
            <li><spam>Heath Hussar</spam>, Top...Next to Matt (Check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/hghussar">Youtube Channel></a>). He's very amusing and I enjoy his jokes and his reaction when being pranked.
            </li>
            <li><spam>Jason Nash</spam>, Next to Heath (Check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JasonNashComedy/featured">Youtube Channel</a>). He is a comdiean so of course he is funny. His saying is "I am not like most teens, I am 45"</li>
            <li><spam>Zane Hijazi</spam>, In the bottom, center (Check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmh5gdwCx6lN7gEC20leNVA">Youtube Channel</a>) I enjoy his videos, especially when he is with his sister, the video just gets more exciting.</li>
            <li><spam>Carly Incontro & Erin Glilfoy</spam>, The pink or red hair(Carly), The blonde hair(Erin)(Check out their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CB_Pf1REAZvz6007aKdqw">Youtube Channel</a>) You can as well check out their personal youtube channel (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/carlyincontro">Carly's Youtube</a>)(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ging13m">Erin's Youtube</a>)</li>
            <li><spam>Scotty Sire</spam> Top right... the guy pointing to the billboard. (Check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/imnotscottysire">Youtube Channel and Music</a>) David doesn't let him be much in the vlogs but overall, he is very funny when he does appear in the vlogs, and the song he made, "Take me away" has gotten very catchy for me.</li>
            <li><spam>Toddy Smith</spam> Top right... the one with the beanie hat. (Check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCky4B_P_AJ9QST2RDdXODWw/featured">Youtube Channel</a>) He is not much in the vlogs, but he is or was consider the most attractive one. I say was, because the guy I am about to talk about next is consider to be attractive as well.(Oh well)</li>
            <li><spam>Josh Peck</spam> {Not in the picture, but you had should of heard of him, at some point in your life} (Check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTr-klXfdXmrU9FEP987ueg/featured">Youtube Channel</a>) If you haven't heard of him he is best known for playing Josh Nichols in the Nickelodeon show Drake & Josh. His sarcasm is the best and gotta love it when he plays the piano and sings something about his friends.</li>
            <li class="josh-point"><img class="josh" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d2/39/1b/d2391be9490b972b4e16697513404aa2.jpg"></li>
            <li><spam>Alex Ernst</spam> {He as well is not in the picture but he is below this}. (Check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheAlexErnstShow/featured">Youtube Channel</a>) Seems seriuos but he is very amusing. I believe that white coffee tables must be his enemy or just really enjoys destroying them...?</li>
