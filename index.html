       <h2>Who is David Dobrik?</h2>
       <p>For those who are curious and don't know much about him. He is a YouTuber and in his channel, he pretty much hangs out with his friends and they prank each other or do dumb stuff, which is hilarious. However, he's not always mean, he has surprised his friends with cars, or whatever they always wanted or dreamed of doing. Although his content sometimes may only be for teens and above, you get out a nice laugh after watching him. (If you want you can  check his Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmh5gdwCx6lN7gEC20leNVA">here.</a>)</p>
       <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p> I enjoy watching David Dobrik vlogs. His content is mostly in the comedy section, and I don't remember a time when the video ended and I didn't laugh or smile once. He and his group of friends (the vlog squad) together, make videos and usually uploads them on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but now he uploads on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturdays. I don't even remember when I even started watching him but, I am glad I found him because he truly makes my day. </p>
