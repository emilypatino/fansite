       <h2>How did it begin?</h2>
       <p>David Dobrik started doing Vine videos in April 2013 and gained around 100,000 followers. However, in October 2016, doing Vine videos didn't last much for him, and for anyone who was involved on making vine videos because unfortunately Vine was being shut down and people could no longer make the 6-second videos. This impacted him on what he does now, which is making youtube videos and in his channel he currently has about 10 million subscribers.</p>
